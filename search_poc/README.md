# search_poc

A Flutter project to test SearchDelegate class and another option.

# Explanation

Generates a list with 10 random numbers and an app bar with 2 search icons.
The first icon will use a `SearchDelegate` and `showSearch` to filter the list.
The second icon will swap the AppBar with a custom one and update on the same screen.

Each icon has a tooltip to differentiate them.
